# Contribution guidelines

This project is kind of **an experiment** from myself but I am more than open to contribution.

Here is the ideal process :

- Have a look at the issues
- If you are working on one, tell me
- If you are working on something else, create an issue to tell me
- Hack some stuff, focus on getting things done (it's JS in the end)
- Then let's have a chat about what you did and try to have it merged
- Thank you in advance
